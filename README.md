#### About Persuasion
During battle, you can try to persuade an enemy to join you in your quest. To persuade them, you can say whatever you want. Unfortunately, the enemies don't speak your language, so your words don't actually have any influence on their decision to join you or not, but they might be swayed by your attempts.

After an enemy has been successfully persuaded to join you in your quest, they will become an ally. Allies will help you in battle and will fight for you to the bitter death. During a given battle, an ally may use one of their turns to heal your character up to one time per fight maximum.
