# The multiplayer update is here.
### Chat with other players and track them on the map in real time!
As this is in very early development stages there may be critical bugs during gameplay.

### Known bugs
- Items may not display in the Merchant menu
- Gambler will spawn regardless of BTC owned
- Maps may not generate correctly
- C4 tends to stop working after single-use by any player
- C4 can destroy exits
- Rarely the {"type":"seen_tiles","seenTiles"} message from client-to-server gets broadcasted in the battle log

#### About Persuasion
During battle, you can try to persuade an enemy to join you in your quest. To persuade them, you can say whatever you want. Unfortunately, the enemies don't speak your language, so your words don't actually have any influence on their decision to join you or not, but they might be swayed by your attempts.

After an enemy has been successfully persuaded to join you in your quest, they will become an ally. Allies will help you in battle and will fight for you to the bitter death. During a given battle, an ally may use one of their turns to heal your character up to one time per fight maximum.
